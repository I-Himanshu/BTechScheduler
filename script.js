Autotrophs produce their own food using light or inorganic compounds, while heterotrophs rely on consuming other organisms for energy. Lithotropes are a subset of autotrophs that use inorganic compounds, such as hydrogen sulfide, for energy. This classification helps understand the ecological roles and nutritional strategies of different organisms."

Uricotelic organisms excrete uric acid, which is less toxic and conserved in organisms like birds. Ureotelic organisms, such as mammals, excrete urea, which is less toxic than ammonia but requires energy for its synthesis.

Genetics is often regarded as the cornerstone of biology, akin to how Newton's laws are foundational to physical sciences. The module covers core concepts like Mendel's laws of inheritance, allele interactions, gene mapping, epistasis, and the genetic processes of meiosis and mitosis. Emphasis will be placed not only on the mechanics of cell division but on how genetic material is passed from parent to offspring. The module will also explore the concepts of recessiveness, dominance, and gene mapping, and how genetic traits are inherited in humans. Real-world examples, such as single-gene disorders, will help students understand the practical applications of genetic principles.",

            "description": "Mendel's laws form the foundation of classical genetics. The Law of Segregation states that alleles for a gene separate during the formation of gametes, meaning that each gamete receives one allele. The Law of Independent Assortment states that genes for different traits are inherited independently of one another, provided they are on different chromosomes. These laws explain how genetic traits are passed from parents to offspring and provide the basic principles for understanding inheritance patterns."

            "description": "An allele is a variant form of a gene. Alleles can be dominant or recessive, influencing the phenotype of an organism. For example, a dominant allele will determine the trait when present, while a recessive allele requires two copies to express the trait. The combination of alleles from both parents forms the genotype, which ultimately determines the phenotype."

            "title": "Gene Mapping",
            "description": "Gene mapping is the process of determining the location of genes on a chromosome. This is crucial for understanding how traits are inherited and how they relate to diseases. The development of genetic maps allows scientists to trace genes associated with certain traits or diseases. Gene mapping uses molecular techniques to map the distance between genes, and this information is essential for genetic counseling, disease diagnosis, and therapy."

          {
            "title": "Gene Interaction and Epistasis",
            "description": "Gene interaction refers to how different genes influence each other's expression. Epistasis occurs when one gene masks the expression of another gene. For example, in coat color in animals, one gene may mask the effects of another, resulting in a single color despite the presence of multiple alleles. Understanding gene interaction and epistasis is important for explaining complex inheritance patterns that do not follow simple Mendelian rules."

            "title": "Meiosis and Mitosis in Genetics",
            "description": "Meiosis and mitosis are essential processes for the transmission of genetic material. Mitosis results in two identical daughter cells, while meiosis produces four genetically diverse gametes. Although the focus of this module is on how genetic material is passed on from parent to offspring, the processes of meiosis and mitosis are critical to understand because they ensure the proper division of chromosomes and genetic material. The key concept is that meiosis contributes to genetic variation, while mitosis ensures cellular growth and repair."

            "title": "Recessiveness and Dominance",
            "description": "In genetics, dominance and recessiveness describe how different alleles affect the expression of a trait. A dominant allele will express its trait even in the presence of a recessive allele. For example, in the case of flower color, a dominant allele for red flowers will express the color even if the plant inherits a recessive allele for white flowers. Recessive traits only manifest when an individual has two copies of the recessive allele. These concepts are fundamental for understanding Mendelian inheritance patterns."

            "description": "Phenotype refers to the observable traits or characteristics of an organism, which result from the interaction of its genotype with the environment. Mapping phenotypes to genes involves identifying which specific genes are responsible for certain traits. This can involve the study of genetic disorders, where mutations in specific genes cause observable traits or diseases. Understanding how phenotypes are linked to genes helps researchers identify genetic causes of diseases and develop potential treatments."

These disorders follow predictable inheritance patterns and are often studied in the context of Mendelian genetics. By studying single-gene disorders, researchers can better understand the genetic basis of disease, inheritance patterns, and potential treatments or interventions."

            "description": "Complementation occurs when two individuals with different mutations in the same gene or related genes exhibit a normal phenotype when crossed. In human genetics, complementation is used to understand genetic diseases by identifying whether different mutations in the same gene can result in the same or different phenotype. This concept is often applied in genetic studies to understand the molecular basis of diseases and how different genetic mutations can interact to produce a specific phenotype."

These simple sugars can link together to form disaccharides (like sucrose) and polysaccharides (such as starch and cellulose). Starch is a storage form of glucose found in plants, while cellulose provides structural support to plant cells. Despite both being polysaccharides, starch and cellulose have different structures and functions, with cellulose being highly resistant to degradation due to its unique bonding patterns."

There are 20 standard amino acids, each with a unique side chain (R-group), that combine to form polypeptides through peptide bonds. Proteins are long chains of amino acids folded into specific three-dimensional structures that enable them to perform a vast range of functions in the body, such as catalyzing biochemical reactions (enzymes), providing structure (collagen), transporting molecules (hemoglobin), and defending against pathogens (antibodies).

A nucleotide consists of three components: a sugar molecule, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. In DNA, the nitrogenous bases are adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G), which pair in a specific way (A-T, C-G) to form the double helix structure. RNA, which plays a key role in protein synthesis, contains the base uracil (U) instead of thymine.
